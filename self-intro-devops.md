## üîç 6. Technical Scenario Questions (Real & Practical)

**Q1:** *If a Kubernetes pod keeps crashing, how would you troubleshoot?*
**Answer:**
I would first check logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>` and then run `kubectl describe pod` to identify the cause ‚Äî maybe OOMKilled, imagePull error, or config issue.

If it‚Äôs resource-related, I adjust the **CPU/memory limits**; if it‚Äôs configuration-related, I check **environment variables, secrets, or networking**.

*Example:* In my lab, a pod kept restarting due to a missing secret mount. Once I corrected it and redeployed, it worked perfectly.

---

**Q2:** *How do you use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring?*
**Answer:**
I use **Prometheus** for collecting metrics and **Grafana** for visualization and alerts. Prometheus scrapes data from **exporters** and Kubernetes nodes, while Grafana provides **dashboards for CPU, memory, and disk usage**.

Alerts are configured via **Alertmanager or Slack**.
*Example:* In my private lab, I monitor all containers, servers, and Kubernetes nodes through Grafana dashboards with custom alert rules.

---

**Q3:** *How do you troubleshoot system issues in Linux?*
**Answer:**
I start with **log analysis** (`journalctl`, `/var/log/messages`), then check **resource usage** using `top`, `iotop`, and `vmstat`. I look for failed cron jobs, misconfigured services, or high CPU processes.

*Example:* Once, I identified a cron job consuming high CPU every night. I optimized the script and the issue was resolved permanently.

## üí∞ 7. Salary Expectation

**Interviewer:** What are your salary expectations?

**You (English):**
I‚Äôm open to discussion. My main goal is to work in a **DevOps-focused environment**, learn continuously, and add measurable value to the organization. I believe the company will offer a fair salary based on my skills and contribution.

## ü§ù 8. Closing & Unique Hook

**Interviewer:** Do you have any questions for us?

**You (English):**
Yes, thank you. I would love to know how your team is currently adopting **DevOps practices**, and how a DevOps Engineer like me can help improve automation and infrastructure scalability in the next few months.

Also, I‚Äôd like to mention something unique about me ‚Äî
I have a **fully functional private cloud lab** that‚Äôs always live. I experiment with **real-world challenges** like pipeline failures, monitoring, backups, and container orchestration. So when I join your team, I‚Äôll bring **both practical and production-ready experience** with me.
